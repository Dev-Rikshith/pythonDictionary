It is a commandline application, made using python programming language. It takes the word from the user and returns its definition from the a json file which is loaded into the program. It also finds the closely matched words and asks the user to choose whether to display the output or not. Incase of multiple meanings it returns all of them in the form of a list.

This Project is designed to put into practice the basics of python programming language.
